A virtual handbook of the algorithms and concepts that span the learn space of the author:

1. The repository is intended to hold implementations of various algorithms and data structures as the author learns them.

2. It will also include concepts that he rediscovers on the way and finds significant enough to be written somewhere.

    ~~3. Finally, it will serve as a storeroom for my some of my (evil) ideas and theories (to take over the world).~~
